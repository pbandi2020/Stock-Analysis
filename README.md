# YTD Multi Stock Data Analysis 
## Overview of Projec
This project is to provide stock market analysis over last few yeas across multiple stocks. The effort will also focus on accurancy, efficience, data formating and customer experience.  

### Purpose & Scope of this Effort
* Year Parameter - Input control allowing the user the ablity to enter the year the analysis to be performed on allowing the ability to select the dataset to be processed.
* Title - Dynamic title with the year parameter be the variable value
* Column Headers - Column headders to support the data visualization
* Dynamic grid data population and YTD return calculation
* Formating - Font, style and conditional formating to provide visualization on negative and positive returns
* Perfoemance - Ensuring the code can handle large datasets and meet customer experience.

# Results
### Performance Analysis based on programming logic implemented
* The below table of data provides multiple ways to achive the end result. As much as we need to provide accuracy in data, it is equally important to user experience. performance is a key user experience aspect. For diffrence in logic, refer to the subroutine in the macro file. The table below lists each subroutine name. Every subroutone results in the same information. the only diffrence is the runtime. Screen shots for each of the analysis is saved to resources folder and the file name should match the subroutine name.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* The orginal data table did not have the data columns needed to derive the resultset and hence had to convert the Launch Date, Category & Subcategory columns. 
* 
 

## Summary
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - Total campaign responses are 1369 and 24 are still in progress/live which can fall into one of the outcome categories of Success, Failed or Cancelled for the Theater category
